# Phase 1 â€“ Data Validation & Operational Insights

## ðŸ§¾ Overview

This initial analysis phase focused on validating data imports and running operational diagnostics across three key tables:  
- `homeowners`  
- `house_addresses`  
- `maintenance_requests`  

We verified record counts, identified vacant properties, summarized request statuses and types, and established foundational JOIN logic for operational visibility.
