# Phase 1 â€“ Data Validation & Operational Insights

## ðŸ§¾ Overview

This initial analysis phase focused on validating data imports and running operational diagnostics across three key tables:  
- `homeowners`  
- `house_addresses`  
- `maintenance_requests`  

I verified record counts, identified vacant properties, summarized request statuses and types, and established foundational JOINS for operational visibility.

**Query:**  
```sql
SELECT *  
FROM house_addresses  
WHERE homeowner_id IS NULL;```
```

### Insight

**3 properties** were found with no associated `homeowner_id`.  
These likely represent **vacant, transitional, or unassigned properties**.

> *Strategic Opportunity:* Flag these addresses for **resale preparation, rental onboarding, or inspection cycle planning**. This early diagnostic supports proactive asset utilization in HOA operations.
