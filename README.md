# HOA & Homeowners Operational SQL Analysis  
A diagnostic SQL analysis project uncovering operational insights from maintenance requests, property conditions, and homeowner activity in a small residential community.

---

## Business Objective  
The HOA (Homeowners Association) is facing a growing backlog of unresolved maintenance requests, aging property infrastructure, and operational blind spots due to fragmented homeowner data.

This project simulates how SQL-based diagnostics can identify:  
- Request volume bottlenecks  
- Aging housing inventory  
- Vacant or inactive properties  
- Maintenance type trends and workload balance

---

## Key Questions  
- Which homeowners submit the most maintenance requests?  
- How many requests remain unresolved — and for how long?  
- Which maintenance types dominate service workload?  
- Are there aging or neglected properties that require prioritization?  
- Do any homes lack ownership or maintenance linkage?

---

## Tools & Skills  
- PostgreSQL  
- SQL JOINs, Aggregations, Filtering, CASE statements  
- Data Diagnostics & Operational Auditing  
- Markdown Documentation & GitHub Structuring  
- Strategic Recommendations (Based on Query Outputs)

## Summary Insights  
- **65% of open/in-progress requests** have been unresolved for over 600 days.  
- **13 homes are under 20 years old**; **4 are over 60 years old**.  
- **Lawn Care** and **Roof Repair** dominate the request workload.  
- **3 idle properties** have no linked homeowners or maintenance activity — possible candidates for inspection or resale.
