# Strategic Recommendations – Phase 2: HOA Maintenance & Property Operations

This strategic briefing translates the Phase 2 analysis into actionable guidance for HOA operations leadership. Based on 30 homeowner properties and 20 maintenance requests analyzed in PostgreSQL, the following recommendations target service backlog, property condition risk, and asset oversight gaps.

---

## 1. Address Long-Term Open Maintenance Requests

**Findings:**
- 10 requests are marked “In Progress,” with one open for **725 days**.
- Over **65% of open/in-progress requests** have been pending **400+ days**.

**Recommendations:**
- Implement **tiered aging alerts** at 30, 60, 90, and 180+ days.
- Launch a **maintenance request audit** to identify stalled tickets and causes.
- Allocate emergency resources to reduce high-risk backlog.

## 2. Prioritize Inspection of Aging Properties

**Findings:**
- **4 properties (13%)** are over 60 years old.
- **8 additional homes** fall into the 41–60 year range.
- These properties represent **risk of structural fatigue**, outdated plumbing, and electrical hazards.

**Recommendations:**
- Establish a **preventive inspection program** for homes 40+ years old.
- Link age segmentation to maintenance request patterns to detect early warning signs.
- Consider offering **voluntary upgrade programs** for older infrastructure.

## 3. Flag Vacant Properties Without Service Records

**Findings:**
- 3 properties are vacant and have **no linked maintenance history**.
- These homes are currently **unmonitored** from an operational perspective.

**Recommendations:**
- Introduce a **“Vacancy Watchlist”**: properties with no owner and no service history.
- Schedule seasonal inspections for all vacant homes.
- Tag these properties in dashboards for ongoing visibility.

## Implementation Guidance

To support execution:
- Embed these recommendations into a Power BI dashboard view.
- Visualize maintenance aging, property segmentation, and vacancy risk together.
- Develop KPI indicators: % of homes with aging tickets, % of homes over 40 years old, and count of unserviced vacant homes.

---

## Strategic Outcome

By integrating backlog triage, infrastructure forecasting, and vacancy control, the HOA can:
- Improve resident satisfaction
- Reduce long-term costs
- Mitigate deferred risk
